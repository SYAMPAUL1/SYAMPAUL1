## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Data Engineer and NLP Researcher** with 3+ years of experience designing scalable data pipelines, deploying machine learning models, and engineering cloud-native analytics platforms.

From reducing ETL runtimes by 30% with Spark to delivering low-latency fraud detection systems in production, I love turning raw data into real-time business impact. I recently completed my NLP research internship at **Queen Mary University**, where I focused on **Word Sense Disambiguation** for low-resource languages using **Telugu-BERT** and **MURIL**.

I have **Right to Work in the UK** and am passionate about solving real-world problems using AI, cloud engineering, and data science.
